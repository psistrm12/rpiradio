RPiRadio
========

A simple internet radio player for the Raspberry Pi. 

**Features:**

* written in Python
* requires two rotary encoders and two push button switches as input devices
* uses the Gstreamer-1.0 library for all the streaming stuff
* reads and displays metadata from internet radio streams
* can decode and play mp3, aac and ogg audio streams (and probably more due to the power of the GStreamer decodebin)


*A more detailed description will follow soon...*
